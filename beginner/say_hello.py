# Write a Python program that:

#     Stores your name and age in variables.
#     Prints a greeting message like:
#     "Hello, my name is Joy and I am 760 years old."
#     Then, print what your age will be in 5 years using the same variable.

name = "Joy"
age = 213409432

print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old")
print(f"I will be {age + 5} years old in 5 years ")
